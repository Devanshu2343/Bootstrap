  <h1>AI</h1>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to imitate human intelligence, enabling them 
    to learn, plan, think, and solve problems. It involves developing computer systems capable of performing tasks 
    that traditionally require human intelligence, such as reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving. AI encompasses 
    technologies like machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.
